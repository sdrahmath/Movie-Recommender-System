# Movie Recommender System

This project is a movie recommendation app based on a content-based machine learning algorithm. The app suggests similar movies based on the selected movie's attributes such as genre, release year, and rating.

## Description

The Movie Recommender System utilizes a content-based approach, where movies are recommended based on their similarity to the selected movie. The similarity is calculated using features such as genre, release year, and rating. The app fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and uses the dataset to generate recommendations.
